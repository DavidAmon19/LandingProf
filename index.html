                <h3> My name is Amanda Barros & I am a postpartum doula</h3>
                <p>
                    Hello, I'm Amanda, a dedicated postpartum doula with a rich background in childcare, having spent
                    years as a nanny. My profound connection to the intricacies of infancy and family dynamics led me to
                    embrace the role of a postpartum doula. I am passionate about supporting families during the magical
                    and vital period of early motherhood. As your doula, my commitment extends beyond practical
                    assistance to creating a nurturing space where you feel heard, understood, and empowered. I provide
                    emotional support, share insights into newborn care, and assist with breastfeeding. Beyond my doula
                    services, I am an advocate for community building and fostering connections, aiming to navigate
                    challenges and celebrate the joys of motherhood together. I invite you to reach out with questions
                    or to discuss tailoring my services to your unique needs, as I eagerly anticipate being a part of
                    your support team during this extraordinary and transformative time in your life.</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">I can recommend Amanda wholeheartedly. She has been helping care for our medically complex 7 month old son for a while now. She has been undeterred and eager to help in spite of his high needs (e.g. NG tube, post-op sternal precautions, etc)From the first time we met her, it was evident was a caring, genuine, capable, dependable and professional person she is. She cares deeply about our son's well-being and health, always sharing detailed reports at the end of her shifts and even texting on her days off to see how he's doing. During the times when she's with our son, my husband and I can sleep well knowing that he's in Amanda's hands.</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">We feel incredibly lucky to have worked with Amanda as our night doula for our first baby. She was amazing with our newborn, and has that special touch that made baby (and us) feel comfortable from day one. She was always on time, and took notes throughout the night to help get him on a better feeding schedule (which meant more sleep for me!) she always checked in during the day to see how he was eating/sleeping and had some really helpful tips that I am still using to this day. I couldn't recommend her more.</p>
